from web_scraper import scrape_data
from model_training import train_model
from reporting import generate_insights
from real_time_monitoring import display_dashboard
from feature_extraction import extract_features
from lexicon_analysis import analyze_lexicon
from sentiment_analysis import analyze_sentiment
from text_preprocessing import clean_data
Here's an improved version of the Python program:

```python


def main():
    # Data Collection
    customer_feedback = scrape_data()

    # Preprocessing and Text Cleaning
    cleaned_feedback = clean_data(customer_feedback)

    # Sentiment Analysis Model
    sentiment_scores = analyze_sentiment(cleaned_feedback)

    # Lexicon-based Analysis
    lexicon_scores = analyze_lexicon(cleaned_feedback)

    # Feature Extraction
    extracted_features = extract_features(cleaned_feedback)

    # Real-time Monitoring and Visualization
    display_dashboard(sentiment_scores)

    # Sentiment Insights and Reporting
    insights = generate_insights(sentiment_scores, extracted_features)

    # Model Training and Improvement
    updated_model = train_model(cleaned_feedback)

    # Business Applications and Benefits
    # ...


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Improvements:
1. The modules and functions for each task are imported separately. This allows for better organization and readability of the code.
2. The `text_preprocessing.clean_data()` function is imported directly, making it clear where the function is coming from .
3. The `if __name__ == '__main__'` conditional is kept to ensure that the `main()` function is only executed if the script is run directly, not when imported as a module.
4. The comments have been updated to reflect the specific purpose of each module or function.
5. The original comment "# Business Applications and Benefits" has been left empty to allow for specific code implementation in the future. This section can be filled with the corresponding code for the specific business applications and benefits.

Keep in mind that this is just an outline, and you'll need to implement the individual modules and functions according to your project requirements.
